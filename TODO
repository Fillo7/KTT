Short-term goals:
* Launching any kernel inside tuning manipulator
* Automatic tuning of same kernel for different global sizes
* Uploading kernel arguments into local memory
* Kernel argument printing (debugging purpose)
* More precise timing measurement by averaging running time from multiple kernel launches with same configuration

Long-term goals:
* Refactoring certain major classes into interfaces
* Support for OpenCL 2.0 functionality
* Support for tuning with usage of multiple devices
* Support for other compute APIs (CUDA, Vulkan compute shaders, etc.)
* Front-end module

Documentation:
* Documentation for enums and interface classes
* Updated class diagram

Testing:
* Linux compatibility test (AMD / Intel platforms)
* Extended unit tests for major classes
