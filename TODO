Core functionality:
* Result printing (various forms of output)
* Tuning manipulator (custom code injection and time measurement)
* Result validation (kernel / class)
* Uploading kernel arguments into local memory
* AnnealingSearcher

Core extensions:
* Kernel argument printing (debugging purpose)
* Refactoring certain major classes into interfaces

Documentation:
* Documentation for API and other significant headers
* Updated class diagram

Testing:
* Linux compatibility test
* Extended unit tests for major classes

Future extensions:
* Automatic tuning of same kernel for different global sizes
* Usage of OpenCL 2.0 functionality for supported SDKs
* Support for other compute APIs (CUDA, Vulkan compute shaders, etc.)
* Support for tuning with usage of multiple devices
