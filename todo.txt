Minor features:
* More precise timing measurement by averaging running time from multiple kernel launches with same configuration
* Ability to set timeout for kernel runs that take too long
* Detection of invalid configurations during configuration computation (eg. configurations with work-group size larger than the current device allows)
* Updated class diagram
* Linux compatibility test (AMD / Intel platforms)

Major features:
* Support for uploading kernel arguments into local memory, including ability to control local memory size with parameters
* Automatic tuning of same kernel for different global sizes
* Extended unit tests for major classes
* Support for OpenCL 2.0 functionality
* Support for tuning with usage of multiple devices
* Support for additional compute APIs (CUDA, Vulkan compute shaders)
* Front-end module
