Description of KTT classes:

Tuner API
- API similar to that of CLTune project, contains new functionality (validation using C++ method,
  ability to modify kernel arguments between individual kernel launches, ...)
  
Tuner Core
- main part of the tuner, enables cooperation of individual classes, utilized directly by Tuner API

Kernel Manager
- manages C++ kernels, enables kernel addition, modification and additional functionality
  needed during the autotuning process

Kernel
- holds data of a single kernel (arguments, parameters, source code, ...)

Compute API Driver
- C++ wrapper for given compute API (Opencl, CUDA, ...)

Tuning Executor
- oversees autotuning launch and execution, utilizes 3 subclasses

Searcher
- enables choice of a method for processing space of tuning parameters, same functionality
  as Searcher inside CLTune project

Tuning Manipulator
- enables modification of Tuning Executor behavior (eg. injection of custom C++ code before / after
  individual kernel executions)

Result Validator
- valides output from individual kernel launches during autotuning, utilizes either reference kernel
  or C++ method
